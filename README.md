Forge boarding passes to put you in the first boarding group and get through
the bourgeoisie security line.

# United
Check in and click the "Print Boarding Documents" button which will open a
popup window with your boarding pass.  Save the boarding pass page as
"Web page, complete" into the BPForge directory; using the defaults, it
should create a "Boarding documents.html" file and a directory,
"Boarding documents_files" with "print.html" therein.  Run united.pl,
open the html file (`open Boarding\ documents.html`) and print it.

Only tested with Chrome on Mac.  In Firefox, you might need to save the page
from the "This frame" context menu
