Forge boarding passes to put you in the first boarding group and get through
the bourgeoisie security line.

# United
Check in and click the "Print Boarding Documents" button which will open a
popup window with your boarding pass.  Save the boarding pass page as
"Web page, complete" into the BPForge directory.  Run united.pl with the
just-save HTML file as an argument.  The script will enhance your boarding
pass which you can open (`open Boarding\ documents.html` from your terminal)
and print.

Only tested with Chrome on Mac.  In Firefox, you might need to save the page
from the "This frame" context menu.

# TODO
- Continental merger seems to have mucked this up, like everything else
- Make this easy to use
